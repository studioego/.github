My Name is DaeHyun Sung.

I'm *Korean Free/Libre Open Source Contributor & Developer*. My hobby is Learning Language(English,漢語/汉语/Chinese,日本語/Japanese).

I’m from Korea Peninsular’s South-east Area, Gyeongsang Province(경상도/慶尙道) region, Korea. Now, I live in south-east side of Seoul(서울), Korea.

I’m Korean. My mother tongue is Gyeongsang dialect of Korean. But I can speaks Both Standard Korean[표준말 or 표준한국어/標準韓國語] and Gyeongsang dialect of Korean[경상도사투리 or 경상방언/慶尙方言].

my Twitter id is @studioego 

I contribute to improve Korean Language on FLOSS  in my spare time mostly.
Also, I’m learning East asian Languages(such as Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese). 
Because, Three Languages(Chinese, Japanese, Korean) use Chinese Character 漢字(It also called "Ideographs") and share a similar culture.
I am curious as I study the commonalities and differences in studying East asian languages.
Also I translate into Korean on many of FLOSS(Free/Libre Open Source Software). and I visit some historic site and take pictures in Korea.
